# Fishing Empire Introduction
Our coding project is is a gui based game called Fishing Empire. Fishing empire is all about catching fish in a timing-based minigame, then selling them for upgrades. The main objective is to get as many points as you can while also buying power-ups and better fishing rods. We created this game for the final project at the Tufts Precollege Coding Academy. 

# How to Run the Game
In order to run the file, you must first download pygames. After that, all you need to do is get the code from our repository in git hub and clone it. Finnaly, run the code in your python terminal and ENJOY!

# Interations
Once in the game, there are many things you can do. Along with fishing, the most obvious one, you can also look up your inventory and buy items from the shop. In order to access these pages, we created simple icons which when pressed, lead you to the inventory/shop page. The only time you will need to press a key on your computer is when you start to fish. Other than that, everything can be done with the click of a button.

# Files
```game.py``` contains the main code for the game, which the user should run. ```classes.py``` contains classes for rarity, fish, and the player, and ```FishFunctions.py``` includes main functions for the game.
The game's sprites and other images are contained in ```images```.

This game was created by Shea Patel, Tim Slater, Matt Schoenfeld, Ishwar Madhusudan, and Owen Chen

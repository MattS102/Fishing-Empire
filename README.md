# Fishing Empire
Fishing empire is a game about catching fish in a timing-based minigame, then selling them for upgrades. 
We created this game for the final project at the Tufts Precollege Coding Academy

```game.py``` contains the main code for the game, which the user should run. ```classes.py``` contains classes for rarity, fish, and the player, and ```FishProject(SHEA)``` includes main functions for the game.
The game's sprites and other images are contained in ```images```.

This game was created by Shea Patel, Tim Slater, Matt Schoenfeld, Ishwar Madhusudan, and Owen Chen
